## Part 2: Device Hardening Techniques

:interrobang: Question 6 - What is device hardening and why is it important? <br>

:interrobang: Question 7 - List three device hardening techniques discussed in lecture.<br>

:interrobang: Question 8 - Describe how the device hardening techniques listed in the previous question harden the security of a system/network. <br>

:interrobang: Question 9 - Consider some of the cyber attack discussed in part 1 of this lab. Which attacks would the device hardening techniques you have identified in question 3 protect against. <br>

:interrobang: Question 10 - What is the difference between a `vulnerability` and an `exploit`? <br>

:interrobang: Question 11 - We talked about disconnecting unused services, ports, and interfaces this week. Why is it so important to disable something that's not in use? <br>


## Part 3: Mitigation Techniques

:interrobang: Question 12 - What is `IPS signature management`? <br>

:interrobang: Question 13 - What are `honeypots` (in the world of security) and how do they work? <br>

:interrobang: Question 14 - What is the purpose of `pen-testing`? <br>

:interrobang: Question 15 - What is a `hash` and how can it help with file integrity monitoring? <br>

:interrobang: Question 16 - What the `Principle of Least Privilege`? <br>

:interrobang: Question 17 - How does `role separation` minimize the damage one user can inflict? <br>

:interrobang: Question 18 - The below image is an example of what?  <br>

<img src=images/fig4.png>

## Part 4: Network Segmentation

:interrobang: Question 19 - Describe the difference between `physical`, `logical`, and `virtual` segmentation. <br>

:interrobang: Question 20 - What is a `DMZ` and how does it offer network segmentation? <br>

:interrobang: Question 21 - Why is network segmentation important for both internal and external communication? <br>

:interrobang: Question 22 - What does it mean if a system is `air gapped`? <br>


## Part 5: Submission
