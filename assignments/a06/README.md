:interrobang: Question 2 - What are the different layers in cloud computing?<be>

:interrobang: Question 3 - Define `SaaS` in your own words. <br>

:interrobang: Question 4 - Have you used *Software as a Service* on a cloud platform, maybe without realizing it? If so, what service? If not, provided an example of cloud hosted software service.<br>

:interrobang: Question 5 - `IaaS` can save the upfront cost of hardware. Why? <br>

:interrobang: Question 6 - What is the platform as a service? <br>

:interrobang: Question 7 - Describe how `PaaS` can act as a hybrid of `SaaS` and `IaaS`. <br>

:interrobang: Question 10 - Compare and contrast some differences between cloud and traditional data centers. <br>

:interrobang: Question 11 - Describe some advantages of cloud services? <br>

## Part 2: An Overview of DNS

:interrobang: Question 12 - In your own words, describe what `DNS` is and how does it work.<br>

:interrobang: Question 13 - Describe the processes (in detail) identified by each label in the below diagram. <br>

:interrobang: Question 14 - How does the DNS hierarchy work and why is it important? <br>

:interrobang: Question 15 - Describe the differences between internal, external, and third-party DNS servers. <br>

## Part 3: DNS Record Types

:interrobang: Question 16 - What are DNS `resource records`? <br>

:interrobang: Question 17 - What function does the DNS Address record (A)/(AAAA) perform? <br>

:interrobang: Question 18 - What function does the DNS Canonical Name record perform? <br>

:interrobang: Question 19 - What function does the DNS Mail Exchanger record perform?<br>

:interrobang: Question 20 - What function does the DNS Name Server record perform?<br>

:interrobang: Question 21 - What function does the DNS Pointer record perform?<br>

:interrobang: Question 22 - What function does the DNS Text record perform?<br>


## Part 4: DHCP Addressing Overview

:interrobang: Question 23 - DHCP stands for `_____` <br>

:interrobang: Question 24 - Enumerate the steps needed for a DHCP server to dynamically assign an IP address to a host machine on a network.  <br>

:interrobang: Question 25 - How do DHCP servers serve the same static IP address to a specific devices each time it connects to that network? <br>

## Part 5: Configuring DHCP

:interrobang: Question 26 - When configuring a DHCP server, list some of the important scope properties needed for a DHCP server to function properly. <br>

:interrobang: Question 27 - What is an IP address pool? <br>

:interrobang: Question 28 - Recall our `Configuring a DHCP Server (Lab 04)` lab. Did implementing a DHCP server yourself contribute to your understanding of how DHCP works? Elaborate. <br>

## Part 6: Network Time Protocol (NTP)

:interrobang: Question 29 - Why is NTP critical for day-today network connectivity? <br>

:interrobang: Question 30 - How can we mitigate the time synchronization issue that presents itself when NTP clients are far (in terms of distance) from the NTP server? <br>
