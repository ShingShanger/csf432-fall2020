## Part 1: Copper Cabling

:interrobang: Question 1 - Describe some of the limitations copper cabling have over fiber optic cabling. <br>

:interrobang: Question 2 - What does the below image convey about twisted pair cabling? <br>

<img src="images/fig1.png">

:interrobang: Question 3 - Compare and contrast UTP and STP cabling.  <br>

:interrobang: Question 4 - Consider the networking cable below. Describe in detail what the writing on the cable jacket tells you about this cable's specifications. The writing on the label is duplicated below: <br>

> CAT6 UTP PATCH CORD TIA/EIA 5688

:interrobang: Question 5 - What is a `Plenum space`? <br>

:interrobang: Question 6 - How do coaxal cables differ from UTP or STP cable types?<br>

## Part 2: Copper Connectors

:interrobang: Question 7 - Identify the connectors below. <br>

<img src="images/fig3.png">

* Label A = `_______` <br>
* Label B = `_______` <br>
* Label C = `_______` <br>
* Label D = `_______` <br>
* Label E = `_______` <br>
* Label F = `_______` <br>

## Part 3: Optical Fiber

:interrobang: Question 8 - Optical fiber uses `_______`  as a signal medium. <br>

:interrobang: Question 9 - Why are optical fiber cables difficult to monitor or tap when compared to copper cabling? <br>

:interrobang: Question 10 - Why is it important to limit the amount of reflection (have a high return loss) in fiber optic cables? <br>

:interrobang: Question 11 - What are two common light sources used in fiber optic communication? <br>

## Part 4: Optical Fiber Connectors

:interrobang: Question 12 - Identify the connectors below. <br>

<img src="images/fig4.png">

* Label A = `_______` <br>
* Label B = `_______` <br>
* Label C = `_______` <br>
* Label D = `_______` <br>

## Part 5: Copper Termination Standards

:interrobang: Question 13 - Identify the copper termination standards below: <br>

> Notice how the twisted pair cables are unwound and set at the termination point - setting the out-pin configuration. This graphic does a nice job keeping track of those twisted pairs once unwound.

* Label A = `_______` <br>
* Label B = `_______` <br>

## Part 6: Network Termination Points

:interrobang: Question 14 - 66 Blocks are primarily used for `_______`. <br>

:interrobang: Question 15 - How to 66 blocks differ from 110 blocks? <br>

:interrobang: Question 16 - How do RJ-45 patch panels make life easier for network administrators in the event where an employee has to move their workstation? <br>

:interrobang: Question 17 - Describe how 110 blocks work. Describe the 110 block's layered approach to patching cooper connections <br>

:interrobang: Question 18 - Identify the below network termination points. <br>

* Image D = `_______` <br>

:interrobang: Question 19 - When installing fiber distribution panels, it's always a good idea to include a service loop. What is the motivation for ensuring a service loop is part of the fiber distribution installation? <br>


## Part 7: Network Transceivers

:interrobang: Question 20 - In your own words, describe the function of a network transceiver. <br>

:interrobang: Question 21 - List the different variations and form factors of network transceiver that we discussed this week. <br>

* Must have a maximum data rate of 16 Gbit/s 
* Must have a small form-factor
* Must be bi-directional
