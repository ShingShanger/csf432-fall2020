## Part 1: Networking Devices 

:interrobang: Question 1 - Describe the following network devices, services, or frameworks. In your description, include the main purpose that devices is used for and how it achieves that goal.

* Hub
* Bridge
* Switch
* Router
* Firewall
* Wireless Access Point
* Modem
* Media Converter

:interrobang: Question 2 - Describe in detail three of the four identification techniques used by IDS and IPS systems we discussed this week. How do they differ in their approach for discovering intrusions.<br>

:interrobang: Question 3 - Do a quick google search for VPN providers. Pick one and describe some of the security features they offer.<br>

:interrobang: Question 4 - The "router" that you get from your ISP to connect to the internet usually has more than one role. That is, it's likely that your ISP has combined several device into the one device that you connect to. List all of the network devices that your ISP has combined. This doesn't have to be exact, but if you want to be you can usually console into your own home router and look at all of it's configuration options (google how to log into your ISPs router).<br>


## Part 2: Virtual Networking

:interrobang: Question 7 - Compare and contrast Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors.<br>

:interrobang: Question 8 - In CSF 432, what type of hypervisor do we use?<br>

:interrobang: Question 9 - What is a shared network address (in relation to a guest and host machine)<br>

:interrobang: Question 10- - What is a bridged network address? (in relation to a guest and host machine)<br>

:interrobang: Question 11 - What is a private address (in relation to a guest and host machine)<br>

## Part 3: Network Storage

:interrobang: Question 12 - What are jumbo frames and how can the improve the efficiency when connecting to network storage devices.<br>

:interrobang: Question 13 - You need to make a minor spelling change on a document stored on a network storage device. Which type of network storage device would allow you to make this change efficiently.<br>

## Part 6: WAN Technologies

:interrobang: Question 22 - Describe the following WAN technologies:<br>

* Frame Relay
* ATM
* MPLS
* PPP
* PPoE
* DMVPN
* SIP Trunking


## Part 7: WAN Termination

:interrobang: Question 23 - What is a `demarcation point`? <br>

:interrobang: Question 24 - What point / network device in your home network is the demarcation point?<br>

:interrobang: Question 25 - Are smartjacks found on the customer side of a WAN connection or on the provider side? <br>
