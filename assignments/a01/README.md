:interrobang: Question 19 - What is IP Fragmentation? 

## Part 4: Ethernet

:interrobang: Question 20 - Consider the network diagram below. Label each region using the following labels. `Switch`,`Router`,`Internet`,`Access Point`.

<img src="images/fig3.png">

Label A = `_______` <br>
Label B = `_______` <br>
Label C = `_______` <br>
Label D = `_______` <br>

:interrobang: Question 21 - Define the below terms:

* Internet
* Router
* Switch
* Access Point

:interrobang: Question 22 - What does `MAC Address` stand for and what is it used for?

## Part 5: Network Switching

:interrobang: Question 23 - Describe three important functions a `switch` performs.

:interrobang: Question 24 - What is a `MAC Address Table` and and what is it used for?

:interrobang: Question 25 - Assume a MAC address destination is received by a switch and the switch has no record of the destination MAC address. How would that switch handel that traffic?

:interrobang: Question 26 - In your own words, describe what happens when a switch "floods a network"?

:interrobang: Question 27 - What does the below terminal command do?

 ```bash
  $ arp -a
  ``` 

  :interrobang: Question 28 - What is an ARP request?

  ## Part 6: Broadcast Domains and Collision Domains

:interrobang: Question 29 - Assume Device A sends a broadcast within it's broadcast domain. Device B is on the network but there is a router between Device A and Device B. Does Device B receive Device A's broadcast message?

:interrobang: Question 30 - Considering the scenario described in Question 29, replace the word router with the word switch. With this change, does Device B receive Device A's broadcast message?

:interrobang: Question 31 - What network device can be used to segment broadcast domains?
