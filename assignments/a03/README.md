## Part 1: IPv4 and IPv6 Addressing

:interrobang: Question 1 - What is a subnet mask? <br>
:interrobang: Question 2 - What two things does a subnet mask allow you to identify?<br>
:interrobang: Question 3 - How many bits is an IPv4 address?<br>
:interrobang: Question 4 - How many bits is an IPv6 address?<br>
:interrobang: Question 5 - What advantages do we recognize by increasing the number of bit represent of an IP address (IPv4 to IPv6)? <br>
:interrobang: Question 6 - What does a double colon signify in IPv6?<br>
:interrobang: Question 7 - Compress the following IPv6 address `2600:DFFA:0000:0000:000A:BE00:0000:00B1` <br>
:interrobang: Question 8 - Expand the following IPv6 address `2001:4860:4860::8`<br>

## Part 2: Configuring IPv6

:interrobang: Question 9 - Define `Dual-stack routing`<br>
:interrobang: Question 10 - Do IPv4 and IPv6 "talk" to each other?<br>
:interrobang: Question 11 - Define IP Tunneling (6-to-4/4-in-6) <br>
:interrobang: Question 12 - How does IPv6 find other devices on a network (hint: IPv6 does *not* use broadcasts).<br>
:interrobang: Question 13 - When searching for a router, `RS` and `RA` stand for `_______` and `_______`, respectively. <br>
:interrobang: Question 14 - What is the IPv6 Multi-cast address to find all IPv6 routers on the network? <br>
:interrobang: Question 15 - Because IPv6 does not have ARP, how can you find the MAC address of a device on your network? <br>

## Part 3: Prioritizing Traffic

:interrobang: Question 16 - What is packet (traffic) shaping? <br>
:interrobang: Question 17 - QoS stands for?<br>
:interrobang: Question 18 - Are QoS policies constrained to a specific level of the OSI model?<br>

## Part 4: Network Address Translation (NAT)

:interrobang: Question 19 - Why is NAT critical for IPv4 devices right now? <br>
:interrobang: Question 20 - Under what circumstances would an IP address be not routable over the internet?

## Part 5: Submission
