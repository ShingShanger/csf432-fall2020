Primary: *CompTIA Network+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, Seventh Edition (Exam N10-007) | Author: Mike Meyers | ISBN-13: 978-1260122381, ISBN-10: 1260122387*

Secondary: *Elementary Information Security, Third Edition | Author: Richard E. Smith | ISBN-13: 978-1284153040, ISBN-10: 1284153045*


### Software

No purchases required; special-purpose software provided through Brightspace or download.

### Course Format 

For this course, you should expect to complete between 15 - 20 hours worth of coursework each week.

Each week will begin on Friday and end on the Sunday of the following weekend. Assignments will be due each Sunday (at 11:55p). 

### Readings

Reading assignments should be completed as early in the week as possible. Reading the assigned pages in the textbook gives you an idea of the concepts that are the focus for the week. Other assignments during the week help to explain the concepts in greater depth and give you experience applying them to actual problems. Therefore, since the readings are fundamental to activities for the week, they should be completed first. 

For this course to be successful, you must engage in the material by doing the readings ahead of time, and then complete the labs. You are expected to actively participate by asking questions and joining in our discussions.

In addition to the textbook readings, there may be other readings or videos that outline or expand on key concepts for the week. Reading or reviewing these can help you to understand and organize the material better.


### Quizzes

Each week there will be a quiz that tests your knowledge and understanding of the topics and concepts covered that week.

* You are not permitted to get help from other students when completing quizzes.
* Two lowest quiz grades will be dropped from quiz average

### Exams

There will be a final exam given in this course. Students are to submit their own work on the exam. If you need help or clarification on a problem or exercise, you are to make a post on the discussion forum or contact the TA or instructor.

You are not permitted to get help from other students when completing exams.
Late exams will be penalized the same as late homework assignments.
The material in this course is cumulative, and so the final exam will be cumulative.

### Lab Projects and Assignments

There are practical labs and assignments that must be completed. You are encouraged to walk-through labs or assignments at least twice so that you become comfortable with the commands, tools, and applications used. 

### Discussion Board

The help forum in this course can be a valuable resource. As a computer science or information security professional, there are many times that discussion forums can give you information or insight to quickly solve problems you have run into (and ways to avoid problems in the future). Any question related to troubleshooting or not understanding homework assignments should be directed to the discussion board. When you are stuck on an assignment or consistently run into the same problem, first check the forum to see if someone else had the same problem. If not, post your comment or problem description there. Use descriptive titles for your posts so that other students know what the post is about. **Titles such as “I have a problem” are not acceptable. Please use the assignment or lab number followed up by the question number in the title of your post.** 

>An ideal forum post would be posted under the correct week that you are working on with the title **Assignment03 Question07** or **Lab 05 Question 02**

If you have solved a problem that you see someone else struggling with, feel free to post advice on how to work through the problem! This is part of the community building aspect of this course.

You should contact the teaching staff via email with questions related to grading issues or homework questions that cannot be posted to the discussion board. You should not contact the teaching staff via email with general question related to troubleshooting or not understanding homework assignments.

If you would like to schedule an online or in-person appointment to meet with teaching staff you may do so by contacting them via email. These appointments should be made with a minimum of 24 hrs notice. The teaching staff will not offer help on past-due assignments.


### Grading

Material in any course is not learned or mastered simply by reading the material or watching videos. The student needs to spend the time doing the readings, discussing the issues with fellow students, and doing activities based on the course concepts.

The final grade will be based on individual grades received on lab assignments, exercises assigned from the textbook, participation in the discussion forums and exams. Point values for assignments are based on the level of effort and knowledge required to complete each. The approximate weighting for each area is as follows:

* 30% -- Labs
* 30% -- Assignments
* 20% -- Reading Retention Quizzes
* 20% -- Final Exam

Assignments that are submitted:

* On time are eligible for full credit based on the rubric for the assignment
* Within three days of the due date will be penalized 10% for each day late
* After three days from the original due date will receive a score of 0.

Feedback on quizzes, exams, and exercises will either be available on the course website. You have one week from the posting of a grade to submit any concern about that grade, in an email to staff. Concerns expressed after one week from posting will not be considered.


Grading Scale:

| A [94-100] | A- [90-93] |  B+ [87-89] | B [83-86]  |  B [83-86]  | B- [80-82] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **C+ [77-79]** |  **C [73-76]** |**C- [70-72]** | **D+ [67-69]**  | **D [60-66]** | **F [< 60]**  |


### Academic Integrity

Assignments are to be the result of your individual efforts unless you are told otherwise. It is easy to copy material on the computer; such copying constitutes plagiarism and will earn a 0 on the assignment. In some cases, a charge of plagiarism may result in a failure of the course. Additionally, the charge of academic dishonesty will go on your record in the Office of Student Life. If you need help with an assignment or are not sure if something is acceptable, discuss it with a staff member.

Students are expected to be honest in all academic work. A student's name on any written work, quiz or exam shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result of the student's own independent thought and study. Work should be stated in the student's own words, properly attributed to its source. Students have an obligation to know how to quote, paraphrase, summarize, cite and reference the work of others with integrity. The following are examples of academic dishonesty:

* Using material, directly or paraphrasing, from published sources (print or electronic) without appropriate citation
* Claiming disproportionate credit for work not done independently
* Unauthorized possession or access to exams
* Unauthorized communication during exams
* Unauthorized use of another's work or preparing work for another student
* Taking an exam for another student
* Altering or attempting to alter grades
* The use of notes or electronic devices to gain an unauthorized advantage during exams
* Fabricating or falsifying facts, data or references
* Facilitating or aiding another's academic dishonesty
* Submitting the same paper for more than one course without prior approval from the instructors.

Tools and programs that can be used to break or “hack” into systems should only be used in an ethical, professional and legal manner. This means that they should only be used to test the current strength of security networks that are your own or those that you have explicit written consent from the owner of the systems so that proper improvements can be made. The knowledge presented here is not intended for use in any illegal capacity and is meant to aid the learning and development of Cyber Security and Information Technology practices and concepts only.
